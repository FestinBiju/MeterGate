# MeterGate

**A Razorpay-native agent storefront for paid APIs and digital services.**

## Track
Razorpay Buildathon — **Track 01: AI Growth & Agentic Commerce**

## Problem Statement
Independent Indian digital-service merchants generally lack a simple, self-serve way to make their APIs, datasets, reports, or other digital services transactable by AI buyers end to end.

Today, an AI agent may be able to discover a service or understand what a merchant offers, but the transaction often breaks at pricing, authorization, payment, access provisioning, fulfillment, or auditability. Emerging standards such as ACP, AP2, UCP, and x402 solve parts of this journey, but merchants still have to connect these pieces themselves and safely integrate them with their payment stack.

This creates a gap between **AI discovery** and **actual completed commerce**.

## Proposed Solution
**MeterGate** turns a merchant's existing API or digital service into an agent-readable, payable product.

An AI buyer can:

1. Discover the merchant's available services.
2. Receive a structured, machine-readable quote.
3. Check the purchase against bounded spending rules.
4. Obtain explicit user approval when required.
5. Pay through Razorpay Test Mode.
6. Receive short-lived access to the purchased resource.
7. Retrieve the result automatically.
8. Generate an auditable transaction and fulfillment trail.

The goal is to help merchants become **discoverable, understandable, payable, and fulfillable by AI agents** without giving those agents unrestricted payment or service access.

## Current Milestone

Milestone 2 establishes MeterGate's first durable commerce domain: merchants can register digital services in PostgreSQL, and clients can discover active offerings through a versioned JSON catalog. Payments, quotes, entitlements, and fulfillment execution remain intentionally out of scope.

## Domain Model

- A **merchant** has a stable opaque ID, unique URL-safe slug, public profile, lifecycle status, and audit timestamps.
- A **service** belongs to one merchant and records its type, purchase model, integer minor-unit price, machine-readable input/output schemas, fulfillment expectations, lifecycle status, and audit timestamps.
- Merchant slugs are globally unique. Service slugs are unique within their merchant. Public removal is lifecycle-based; there are no hard-delete endpoints.

## Local Development

Prerequisites: Docker Desktop with Docker Compose, Python 3.13, [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), Node.js 20.9 or newer, and npm.

1. Copy `.env.example` to the repository-root `.env`, replace the local-only `change-me` password in both PostgreSQL values, and keep the Razorpay placeholders empty. This root file is the single dotenv source for Docker Compose and FastAPI.
2. Start PostgreSQL and Redis from the repository root:

   ```powershell
   docker compose up -d --wait
   ```

3. Prepare the database and start FastAPI from a second terminal:

   ```powershell
   Set-Location apps/api
   uv sync --dev
   uv run alembic upgrade head
   uv run python -m app.scripts.seed_dev
   uv run fastapi dev app/main.py
   ```

   FastAPI resolves `.env` from the repository path, not the current working directory. Restart it after changing `.env` so the validated startup settings are rebound.

4. In a third terminal, start Next.js with only the public API origin in its process environment:

   ```powershell
   Set-Location apps/web
   npm install
   $env:NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL = "http://localhost:8000"
   npm run dev
   ```

The API liveness endpoint is `http://localhost:8000/health`. The readiness endpoint is `http://localhost:8000/health/ready` and reports PostgreSQL and Redis connectivity separately. Interactive API documentation is available at `http://localhost:8000/docs`, the public catalog at `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/catalog`, and the frontend at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Development Seed

`uv run python -m app.scripts.seed_dev` idempotently creates the synthetic OrbitIntel merchant and its three demonstration services. It uses no live satellite or payment data and can be run repeatedly without creating duplicates.

## Catalog API

`GET /api/v1/catalog` returns only active merchants and active services in deterministic order. Prices use integer minor units with an explicit currency, and each service includes its purchase type, JSON input/output schemas, and fulfillment characteristics. `GET /api/v1/catalog/services/{service_id}` returns one publicly discoverable service; inactive or unknown records return `404`.
